- Implement mandatory passcode generation using `crypto/rand` for cryptographic security
- Library now ignores any user-provided passcodes to prevent weak or predictable codes
- All generated passcodes are guaranteed to be in secure range 1000-9999

### ‚ú® Added
- Automatic secure passcode generation for all BPay payments
- Comprehensive test suite including integration and security tests
- Passcode generation validation and uniqueness testing
- Enhanced logging for passcode generation debugging
- Generated passcode returned in response metadata for payer use

### üîß Changed
- **BREAKING**: `BPayPaymentRequest.Passcode` field is now ignored during processing
- **BREAKING**: Removed user passcode validation (no longer needed)
- Updated examples and documentation to reflect new passcode behavior
- Enhanced BPay payment processor to always generate fresh passcodes

### üêõ Fixed  
- Corrected currency code from deprecated MRO to current MRU standard
- Improved documentation structure and comprehensive examples

### üìö Documentation
- Added comprehensive documentation and restructured examples
- Updated API documentation to reflect passcode generation behavior
- Added security notes about automatic passcode generation
- Enhanced integration examples with detailed explanations

### üîÑ Migration Guide
For users upgrading from v0.1.0 to v0.2.0:

```go
// Before (v0.1.0) - passcode was required
bpayRequest := &rimpay.BPayPaymentRequest{
    PhoneNumber: phoneNum,
    Amount:      amount,
    Passcode:    "1234", // This was required
    // ...
}

// After (v0.2.0) - passcode is auto-generated and ignored
bpayRequest := &rimpay.BPayPaymentRequest{
    PhoneNumber: phoneNum,
    Amount:      amount,
    // Passcode field can be omitted or will be ignored
    // ...
}

// Extract generated passcode from response
if passcode, exists := response.Metadata["passcode"]; exists {
    // Use the generated passcode for the payer
    fmt.Printf("Generated passcode: %s", passcode)
}
```
